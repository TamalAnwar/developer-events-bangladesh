# Developer Events in Bangladesh

An open list of upcoming public developer events happening in Bangladesh

The problem: Many of the developer focused events are organized and advertised in Facebook; as a result many devs miss important events simply because they were not part of a group, they didn't know the right people or simply if they were not in Facebook. 

This open repo will be a crowdsourced list of upcoming developer focused events which are open to public participation. If you are an event organizer or know about an upcoming event, feel free to send a pull request or open an issue.
